# Reverse Proxy with Logging

## Overview
This project implements a reverse proxy server using Python and the `aiohttp` library. The server listens for incoming HTTP requests from local clients, forwards them to a remote service (using a public IP and port), and returns the response back to the local client. It also includes a logging mechanism that logs errors, warnings, and critical issues, but suppresses `INFO` level logs to avoid log bloat. The log files are stored in a local directory, which is mapped to the container when using Docker.

## Features
- **Proxying Requests**: Accepts incoming requests from local clients, forwards them to remote services, and returns the responses.
- **Logging**: Logs warnings, errors, and critical issues, including details like client IP and request URL.
- **Log Rotation**: The logs are stored in a file that rotates when it exceeds 10MB, and up to 5 backup files are kept.
- **Dockerized**: The application is Dockerized, allowing for easy deployment and scaling.
- **Automatic Restart**: The Docker container is configured to automatically restart on system reboot or if the container stops unexpectedly.

## Requirements
- **Python**: The code requires Python 3.x.
- **Docker**: Docker is required to run the application inside a container.

## Installation and Setup

### 1. Clone the Repository

Clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/reverse-proxy-with-logging.git
cd reverse-proxy-with-logging
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

If youâ€™re running the application locally (outside of Docker), create a virtual environment and install the required Python packages:

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Dockerize the Application

The project is already set up for Docker. To run the application inside a Docker container, follow these steps:

#### Step 1: Build the Docker Image
Navigate to the project directory and build the Docker image:

```bash
docker build -t reverse-proxy-app .
```

#### Step 2: Run the Docker Container
Run the Docker container, ensuring that the logs are stored in a local directory (/path/to/local/log/directory on your machine) and mapped to /app/logs inside the container. Use the --restart flag to ensure the container restarts on system reboot or if it stops unexpectedly.

```bash
docker run -d \
  -v /path/to/local/log/directory:/app/logs \
  --restart unless-stopped \
  -p 8080:8080 \
  reverse-proxy-app
```
**Explanation**:

- -v /path/to/local/log/directory:/app/logs: Maps the local log directory to the container's log directory to persist logs on the host.
- --restart unless-stopped: Automatically restarts the container if it stops or the server is rebooted, except if the container is manually stopped.
- -p 8080:8080: Exposes port 8080 from the container to port 8080 on the host machine.

#### Step 3: Verify the Container
To check if the container is running:

```bash
docker ps
```

To view logs from the running container:

```bash
docker logs <container_id>
```

### 4. Testing the Application
After the container is running, you can send HTTP requests to http://localhost:8080 from your local clients. The server will forward these requests to the appropriate remote services and return the responses.

### 5. Log Files
Log files are stored in the directory you mapped using the -v flag when running the container. You can check the logs for any errors or warnings, including details about the client IP and the request that caused the error.

### 6. Stopping the Container
To stop the running container, you can use:

```bash
docker stop <container_id>
```

To remove the container after stopping it:
```bash
docker rm <container_id>
```

## Usage
The reverse proxy server will:
- Listen on port 8080 on the host machine.
- Map incoming requests from local clients to the corresponding remote services (based on predefined mappings).
- Forward the request to the remote service and return the response to the client.
- Log all errors, warnings, and critical issues, including the client IP and request details.

## Log Rotation
The log files are automatically rotated once the file exceeds 10MB. The logs are stored in the directory /app/logs inside the container, which is mapped to a directory on the host machine. Docker will ensure that the logs are persistent and remain available even if the container is removed or restarted.
